I need a way to look up a node from the label
Actually not necessarily.

If I need a hash can do https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32649704/how-to-generate-hash-from-timestamp

Hmm, the assumption that all nodes are unique is actually not the best. Probably need to move to this
id based method eventually.

Okay whats the ideal flow?
- Some way of getting the dagre node given the label.
- Some way of editing a dagre node given the ID.

The label doesn't need to be a hash imediately. That makes things hard to read.
Alternatively I can think of an easier way of getting all the parents and children of a node.

oh wow when you use graph.edge() or graph.node() there's an elem property

- g.sources()
    - all nodes with no predecessors
- g.sinks()
    - all nodes with no successors i.e. leaves
- g.setParent(v, parent)
- g.parent(v)
    - only applies in compound graphs I think?
- g.children(v)
    - only applies in compound graphs I think?
- g.predecessors(v)
    - imediate predecessors
- g.successors(v)
    - imediate successors
- g.neighbors(v)
    - predecessors and successors
